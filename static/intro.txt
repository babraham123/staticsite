Hi, I'm a Mechanical and Aerospace engineer currently attending Princeton University ('13). I am also completing certificates, or minors, in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Robotics. My fascination with the connection between computing and engineering is reflected in my coursework, as well as in the projects I have pursued on my own time.

Cheers,
Bereket
